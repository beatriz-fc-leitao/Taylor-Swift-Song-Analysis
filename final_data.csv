all too well (10 minute version),"
i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now


oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days

and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh


'causе there we arе again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well


photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
and you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""
keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
and i was thinkin' on the drive down, ""any time now
he's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
you might also like
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to


'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah


well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
runnin' scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
i'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'cause i remember it all, all, all

they say all's well that ends well, but i'm in a new hell
every time you double-cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she?
a never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weepin' in a party bathroom
some actress askin' me what happened, you
that's what happened, you
you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
and he said, ""it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well


and i was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""i'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'cause in this city's barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
i remember it all too well


just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
just between us, do you remember it all too well?
just between us, i remember it (just between us) all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (i was there)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there (oh)
down the stairs, i was there, i was there (i was there)
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it (all too well)
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there
it was rare, you remember it
wind in my hair, i was there, i was there
down the stairs, i was there, i was there
sacred prayer, i was there, i was there

and i'm a monster on the hill
too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
pierced through the heart, but never killed

teal was the color of your shirt
when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
you used to work at to make a little money

were there clues i didn't see?

all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?

bad was the blood of the song in the cab
on your first trip to la
you ate at my favorite spot for dinner
bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
getting lunch down by the lakes

cutting me open, then healing me fine

out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you

gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

we were shaking, blind and hazy
how the hell did we lose sight of us again?
sobbing with your head in your hands

you were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
i feel you, no matter what
the rubies that i gave up

her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off st. louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said, ""how did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
the wedding was charming, if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it ""holiday house""
their parties were tasteful, if a little loud

and they said
""there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything""


rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dalí

""there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen

they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green

free of women with madness, their men and bad habits

and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and longing stares
it's born from just one single glance
but it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times

leave the perfume on the shelf
that you picked out just for him
so you leave no trace behind
like you don’t even exist
take the words for what they are
a dwindling, mercurial high
a drug that only worked
the first few hundred times


and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and stolen stares
they show their truth one single time
but they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times


and you wanna scream
don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
you showed me colors you know i can't see with anyone else
don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
look at this idiotic fool that you made me
you taught me a secret language i can't speak with anyone else

i close my eyes, and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, ""hello""
little did i know


that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet""
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, ""please, don't go,"" and i said

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes""


so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, ""stay away from juliet""

i was begging you, ""please, don't go,"" and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say ""yes""
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

is this in my head? i don't know what to think""
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone

you know i adore you, i'm crazier for you
than i was at 16, lost in a film scene
waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
i'm lost in the lights
american glory faded before me
now i'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
running through rose thorns, i saw the scoreboard
and ran for my life (ah)


no cameras catch my pageant smile
i counted days, i counted miles
to see you there, to see you there
it's been a long time coming, but

it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, ""she's a bad, bad girl"" (okay)
the whole school is rolling fake dice
you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
it's you and me, there's nothing like this
miss americana and the heartbreak prince (okay)
we're so sad, we paint the town blue
voted most likely to run away with you


my team is losing, battered and bruising
i see the high fives between the bad guys
leave with my head hung, you are the only one
who seems to care
american stories burning before me
i'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
darling, i'm scared (ah)

i counted days, i counted miles

uh-huh, the bombs were closer
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uh-huh, the burning embers
i vowed not to fight anymore
if we survived the great war


uh-huh, uh-huh


it turned into something bigger
somewhere in the haze, got a sense i'd been betrayed
your finger on my hairpin triggers
soldier down on that icy ground
looked up at me with honor and truth
broken and blue, so i called off the troops
that was the night i nearly lost you
i really thought i'd lost you

we can plant a memory garden
say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
there's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
and we will never go back

my hand was the one you reached for

i wish it wasn't 4 am, standing in the mirror
saying to myself, ""you know you had to do it""

at any given minute
and it was always on your terms
i waited on every careless word
hoping they might turn sweet again
like it was in the beginning


but your jealousy, oh, i can hear it now
talking down to me like i'd always be around

forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you

across the room, your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you

this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you


the lingering question kept me up
2am, who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
now, i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say
""hey, it was enchanting to meet you""

back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light, go

never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

we blocked the noise with the sound of, ""i need you""
and for the first time, i had something to lose

fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
and the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
and i'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh


well, i tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love

just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


but you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
and you and i fell like an early spring snow

you laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

is the love that you had?

scared not to be hip, scared to get old
chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

dear john,"
long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well, i stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i should've known


well, maybe it's me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
""run as fast as you can""


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now, it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark, twisted games when i loved you so?
i should've known


you are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town

you told me you loved me

the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
i'm not much for dancing, but for you, i did
because i love your handshake, meeting my father

this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i-i-i like it

i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction


this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i, i, i like it


two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you, get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you, follow you home
i'll follow you, follow you home

this daydream is dangerous

ha, time for a little revenge


the story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say ""sabotage""
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from

she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
she's better known for the things that she does

soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge, ha


she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(think about what you did)


she's not a saint and she's not what you think

i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life? tell me, how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good, busier than ever
we small talk, work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why


because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die

so, this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying, ""i'm sorry for that night""
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time


these days, i haven't been sleeping
staying up, playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
and i think about summer, all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall


and then the cold came, the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye


so, this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you, saying, ""i'm sorry for that night""
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time

i miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so, if the chain is on your door, i understand


but this is me swallowing my pride

we'll be outta here as soon as we can

and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin 'round
but in your life, you'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen


when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then, i swore i was gonna marry him someday

to a boy who changed his mind

you're in the car on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
at fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's getting older, too
and don't lose the way that you dance around
in your pjs getting ready for school


oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you
nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to
just try to never grow up


take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up

and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened? please, tell me
'cause one second, it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door

and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, ""forever and always""


was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest, made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore


and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

i threw my phone across the room, at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning, i said we should talk about it
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said, ""okay, let's talk""
and i said

you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad

i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes looking into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancing before bed time
then jumping on me waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand, little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you

""come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years""


i remember the drive home
when the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""why?""
flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and it's about to be halloween
you could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
i remember the last day, when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear


""come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
we'll just disappear
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years""


what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
and what if i kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?

past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now, the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today

i'm thirteen now
and don't know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names

god smiles on my little brother, inside and out
he's better than i am

wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
