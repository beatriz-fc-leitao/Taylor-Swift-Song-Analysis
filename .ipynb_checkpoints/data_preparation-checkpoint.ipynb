    "The Genius API makes it difficult to obtain the album that each track belongs to, so to connect the songs to their respective album, I used a dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarredpriester/taylor-swift-spotify-dataset?select=taylor_swift_spotify.csv) 'taylor_swift_spotify.csv' which contains informaiton about Taylor Swift songs and their respective albums (originally obtained from the spotify API). I joined the relevant columns of the kaggle dataset with the dataframe I previously created. This join results in the following new columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- album: the album to which the song belongs\n",
    "- track_number: number of song in album\n",
    "- release date: release date of album\n",
    "- length: song length in milliseconds\n",
    "- popularity: percent popularity of the song based on Spotify's algorithm\n",
    "- danceability: how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity\n",
    "- accousticness: how acoustic a song is\n",
    "- energy: measure of intensity and activity\n",
    "- instrumentalness: amount of vocals in the song\n",
    "- liveness: probability that the song was recorded with a live audience\n",
    "- loudness: tendency of music to be recorded at steadily higher volumes\n",
    "- speechiness: presence of spoken words in a track\n",
    "- valence: measure of how happy or sad the song sounds\n",
    "- tempo: beats per minute"
